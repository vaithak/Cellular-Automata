# Cellular Automata  
Cellular Automata and Simulation of life using Conway's game.  

## Automata ( plural for Automaton)  
=> An automaton is a mechanical device which performs some function determined by a pre-defined set of instructions.  

=> There is something in Computer Science, called Theory of Automata, which seeks to mathematically describe what  
an automaton can and cannot do.  
=> This part of the science looks at the mathematical properties of all possible automatons (automata), and,  
among other things, defines what problems are computable and what problems are not computable using automata.  

### Cellular Automata  
Wiki Definition  
```
   => A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite 
      number of states, such as on and off. The grid can be in any finite number of  
      dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative  
      to the specified cell. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state 
      for each cell. 
  
   => A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule 
      (generally, a mathematical function)[3] that determines the new state of each cell  
      in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood.  
   
   => Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and  
      does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously.
